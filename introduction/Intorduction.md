## Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically.

Using the right data structure and algorithm makes your program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.

### What are Data Structures?

A data structure is a way to store data.

We structure data in different ways depending on what data we have, and what we want to do with it.

In Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures.

**Primitive Data Structures:-** are basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.

**Abstract Data Structures** are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

### What are Algorithms?

An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal..


### Theory and Terminology

As we go along in this tutorial, new theoretical concepts and terminology (new words) will be needed so that we can better understand the data structures and algorithms.


| Term              | Description                                                                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Algorithm         | A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem.              |
| Data Structure    | A way of organizing data so it can be used efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, and binary trees.               |
| Time Complexity   | A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.   |
| Space Complexity  | A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.   |
| Big O Notation    | A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Used in this tutorial to describe the time complexity of an algorithm.  |
| Recursion         | A programming technique where a function calls itself.                          |
| Divide and Conquer | A method of solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and combining the solutions. Recursion is often used when using this method in an algorithm. |
| Brute Force       | A simple and straightforward way an algorithm can work by simply trying all possible solutions and then choosing the best one.  |
